# R22_app

'R22' is the code to identify a course of [ESIEE](https://www.esiee.fr/) university (Paris). \
Here it's possible to find informations only concerning this code and what it's meant for, in order to retrieve more details about the course itself it would be etter to dig into ESIEE's website.

This application is built with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), an amazing framework backed by Google that allows to develop cross-platform applications.

The reasons why the idea of this application cames out is because the R22 team has a fantastic [Wio Terminal](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-Getting-Started/) with some extra sensors and it's possible to use it to measure some medical parameters such as: Spo2, temperature and movements (with accelerometer).
